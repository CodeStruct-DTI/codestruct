CodeStruct
CodeStruct is a comprehensive, unified platform designed to take users from their first line of code to mastering complex Data Structures and Algorithms. By shifting the focus from "grinding" random problems to understanding underlying patterns, CodeStruct provides a systematic roadmap for interview success and language mastery.

🚀 Key Features
1. Beginner-Friendly Language Roadmaps
Master the building blocks of coding. We don't just teach syntax; we strengthen the connection between a language and its built-in capabilities.

Language Fundamentals: Introduction to C++, Java, and Python.

STL & Collections: Deep dives into standard library functions and built-in data structures.

Bridge Problems: Basic, easy-level challenges specifically designed to practice these functions before jumping into heavy DSA.

2. Pattern-Based DSA Roadmap
Stop memorizing solutions and start recognizing logic. Our curriculum is organized by algorithmic patterns (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Backtracking).

Concept Articles: Detailed guides explaining the "why" and "how" behind each pattern.

Systematic Practice: Curated problems that reinforce the specific pattern you are learning.

Company Tags: Real-world context with data on which top tech companies (Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.) ask these specific questions.

3. Unified Live Coding Dashboard
Your entire coding identity in one place. No more constant tab-switching to check your ratings or contest history.

Profile Aggregator: Connect handles from LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, and more.

Live Updates: Statistics and contest ratings refresh in real-time.

Progress Tracking: Visualize your growth across all platforms on a single, unified interface.

🛠️ Built With
Frontend: [e.g., React.js / Next.js]

Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Express.js]

Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL / MongoDB]

APIs: Custom scrapers/APIs for live profile synchronization.
