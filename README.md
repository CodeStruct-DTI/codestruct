# 🚀 CodeStruct: The Comprehensive DSA Hub

Welcome to **CodeStruct**, a high-performance, neon-noir themed platform designed to streamline your Data Structures and Algorithms journey. 

## 🔴 The Vision
CodeStruct isn't just a tracker; it's a centralized command center for developers to master patterns, track live performance across platforms (LeetCode/Codeforces), and access deep-dive conceptual articles.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** [Next.js 15+](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules (Neon Noir Theme)
* **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
* **Backend:** Node.js / Railway (External)

## 🏛 The Three Pillars
1.  **Unified Dashboard:** Live performance tracking and LeetCode stat integration.
2.  **Pattern Roadmaps:** Structured paths focusing on algorithmic patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.).
3.  **Article Vault:** Deep-dives into complex DSA concepts with optimized visualizations.
